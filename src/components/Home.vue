          Hi, would it not be nice if you came across an assignment that put a smile on your face?
        </p>

          Well, This might not be it. But what it is a working solution.
          A project that just works. Something that has no real meaning, yet important somehow.
        </p>
        <p>
         In all seriousness, I gave less emphasis on design and more on functionality.
          I did not add any pagination in the front end and this was a tradeoff I made for now.
          The backend has pagination properties enabled. The filter function is available for projects and buildings
          as specified in the requirement. The two projects are completely independent of one another.
          The backend has its own <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/">swagger</a> configured.
          Link to <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/">swagger</a> would work if the backend is running by the way .
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming back to work on the front end after such a long time was surely challenging.
          Even though I was not sure how I would feel at first but surely was a good feeling.
          I would have loved to add some table library or bit more of type script.
          That surely would be on my to list.
